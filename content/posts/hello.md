So, i finally "bit the bullet" and started the blog. IÂ´ve been thinking about it for a long time, but personal life combined with work didnt let me with too much time for this, so I decided to just start it with a few "rules" for myself:
<!--more-->
- Im going to write the posts "as i go" or as im working with something that i deem interesting enough or i want to remember.
- The main purpose of the blog posts is for myself to remember  (much of the coding that i do, if i dont use it in 3-6 months, is forgotten) and for stuff that i deem interesting or important to know for others going through the same path as myself.
- I will try to keep away from advanced stuff (as i cant do advanced coding), and keep all posts short and concise
- No shame in spelling mistakes, bad writing, etc.
- Focus on code/python/network automation with a sprinkle of other more code network-related stuff.
- I might abandon this at anytime :P
