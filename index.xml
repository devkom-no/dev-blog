While doing this, and inspired from a &amp;ldquo;100M AWS IPv4 addressess&amp;rdquo; number, researched by Andre Toonk that i read in another blog, i got inspired to check the current status of the IPv4 usage on the cloud providers, and compare their size based on the amount of addresses assigned to their services.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://blog.devkom.no/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 21:50:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devkom.no/posts/hello/</guid><description>So, i finally &amp;ldquo;bit the bullet&amp;rdquo; and started the blog.

Im going to write the posts &amp;ldquo;as i go&amp;rdquo; or as im working with something that i deem interesting enough or i want to remember.</description></item></channel></rss>
